angular-101
===========

Calendar application for the angular-101 workshop

In order to make this work you need npm and grunt-cli installed. 

In order to start coding you have to run:

  npm install 
  
This will install grunt modules as well as bower dependencies in your local copy. If you are using windows you have to run
`bower install` as the post-script configured in the Gruntfile won't work for you.

You can now see the application running at port 3000 if you run the `grunt` command (no args).

Now that everything is ok, we can go back to the first step of the workshop with `git checkout step_0` and start working from there
